// Note that this block really only works with the published version of this
// crate which is found on crates.io. That means the manifest has been
// transformed by `weave.rs` and notably has a bunch of injected precompiled
// dependencies. If we do not have a precompiled dependency then this crate will
// fall back to depending on `cargo-wasix-src` which is the actual `cargo-wasix`
// crate itself, so our fallback simply runs the main function there.
//
// This is sort of a "glorious hack" to severely reduce the compile times of
// this crate (and compile requirements) if you're installing on a platform that
// we have precompiled binaries for. Only if you're installing for a platform
// that doesn't have precompiled binaries do things go awry.
